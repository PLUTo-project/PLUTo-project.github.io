<h1>Literature-Extracted Morphological Data Matrices</h1> <a name="matrix"></a>

During the course of this project we found & extracted over 600 morphology-based phylogenetic data matrices from the published literature. This is an extremely re-usable data type and so is of great value to research now that these files have been made immediately re-usable again. These morphology data files have [their own github repository here](https://github.com/rossmounce/cladistic-data).
